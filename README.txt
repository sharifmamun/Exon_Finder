A novel approach to find the intron-exon positions in EST contigs of Fly insects. 
This codes will need specific datasets to run. If you need datasets, please email me.

The sequences of the code execution will be:
  1. getesty.py
  2. result_handler.py
  3. frame_mapper.py

* checker.py files should exist in the same directory!!!
